            I have always had an eye for nice aesthetic. From young, I would
            spend hours drawing and sketching on papers and desks. I have
            probably costed my parents hundreds in poorly half-drawn, scribbled
            papers.

            In secondary school, I met a friend who introduced me to graphic
            design. As a 9th grader with no income and a new addiction to the
            online world of video games, I was ecstatic to hear that he created
            digital graphics for rappers and artists online for real money. Real
            money that could be irresponsibally spent on digital skins.

            <span className="p-bold">online design collective</span> he created
            in which I partially helped managed as a Creative Director. In a
            way, we were a mini, student-run, design agency.

            Since this was a temporary side hustle/hobby during school, I
